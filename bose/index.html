		<h3>How can I group my speakers?</h3>
		<p>This feature will be added later this summer.</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>Should I allow incoming connections when asked by firewall?</h3>
		<p>Yes, <i>Remote for Bose</i> requires incoming connections to automatically discover your  speakers and to receive updates when their state changes (like volume, playback, source).</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>One of my speakers state does not change in the app but it should.</h3>
		<p>Played song, volume, mute, etc. has changed but the related change is not visible in the app? Sometimes it happens and the best way to fix that is to restart affected speakers, either with <i>Reboot  speakers</i> option or by unplugging the speaker from the power source for a few seconds.</p>
