		<h2><u>Terms of Use</u></h2>
                <h3>Terms of Use</h3>
                <p>
                These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Intellimote: Smart Remote application (“Intellimote” or “Application”) operated by Dariusz Niklewicz (“Developer”, “us”, or “we”).<br/>
                <br/>
                By accessing and using Intellimote, you (“User”) acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these Terms and the Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to use the Services. We may modify these Terms and the Privacy Policy at any time and such modification will be effective upon posting to the Application.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
                <p>
                Some parts of the Application are billed on a auto-renewable subscription basis ("Subscription"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.
                
                Your Subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of your Subscription period unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
                
                You can manage your Subscription or turn off auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the active Subscription period is not allowed. You can also upgrade or downgrade your Subscription plan using Application.
                
                All Subscriptions may be final and non-refundable. By accepting these terms, you agree that Developer is not required to provide a refund for any reason.
                
                Developer may change, modify, or eliminate features of the Subscription at any time, with or without notice. You agree that Developer will bear no liability to you or any third party if Developer does so.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Subscription Fee Changes</h3>
                <p>
                Developer, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will not go into effect automatically; you must opt into the fee change to continue using the Subscription after the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Third-Party Content</h3>

You further acknowledge and agree that Developer shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.
