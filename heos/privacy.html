					<section class="privacy-section">
						<h3>What data is sent to and processed by any external service?</h3>
						<p>The app uses Sentry.io for crash reporting and performance monitoring. When a crash or error occurs, technical data about the error and your system configuration (such as macOS version, app version, and device model) is sent to Sentry. This data helps us identify and fix issues quickly. No personal information is collected through this process.</p>
						<p>The app also uses Mixpanel for analytics and usage insights. Mixpanel collects anonymous usage data such as which features are used, how often the app is opened, and basic system information (macOS version, app version, device model). This data helps us improve the app experience and understand which features are most valuable to users. Mixpanel assigns a random identifier to each installation, but no personally identifiable information is collected or transmitted. You can learn more about Mixpanel's privacy practices at <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their privacy policy</a>.</p>
