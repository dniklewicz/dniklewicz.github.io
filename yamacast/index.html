        <h3>Nothing shows up after launching application.</h3>
        <p>YamaCast does not display any window by default, but it adds an additional icon on the Mac's menu bar displayed on the top of the screen. After clicking it will display application's window.</p>

		<h3>How can I group my speakers?</h3>
		<p>Click LINK icon next to the player and select another speaker from the drop down list.</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>Should I allow incoming connections when asked by firewall?</h3>
		<p>Yes, <i>YamaCast</i> requires incoming connections to automatically discover your  speakers and to receive updates when their state changes (like volume, playback, source).</p>
		<br/>
		<h3>One of my speakers state does not change in the app but it should.</h3>
		<p>Played song, volume, mute, etc. has changed but the related change is not visible in the app? Sometimes it happens and the best way to fix that is to restart affected speakers, either with <i>Reboot  speakers</i> option or by unplugging the speaker from the power source for a few seconds.</p>
